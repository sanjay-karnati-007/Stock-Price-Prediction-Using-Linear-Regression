# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

## Overview

This project involves predicting stock prices using **Linear Regression**, a popular machine learning technique. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and forecast future prices to aid in investment decisions. 

The project is implemented in Python, utilizing various data science libraries and tools to preprocess the data, build the regression model, and visualize the results.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared historical stock price data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for running and documenting the code.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression.ipynb`  
  Contains the complete code and step-by-step documentation of the process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Results

- The Linear Regression model effectively captured the trends in stock price movements.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features like moving averages, trading volumes, or market indicators to improve accuracy.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or LSTMs for better predictions.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time stock price forecasting.
